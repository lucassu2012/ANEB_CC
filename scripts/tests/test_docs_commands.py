"""Guard: every command printed in the operator docs must still be runnable.

Doc drift bit this project three times in one session — the README was eight
tools behind, the runbook's grid-config example used key names the tool does not
read (D-119), and its glob example crashed in the project's primary shell
(D-120). Those were found by hand; this makes the mechanical half automatic.

Static check (no subprocess, so it stays fast): for every `python <script>.py`
command in a fenced block of the operator docs, the script must exist and every
`--flag` used must actually be declared in that script's argparse. It cannot
catch semantic mistakes (a wrong JSON key inside a config file), but it does
catch renamed flags and scripts — the drift that silently makes docs lie.
